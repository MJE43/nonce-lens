# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on debugging and fixing the run results display page where analysis run data is not loading properly. Users are experiencing issues where the "Analysis Run Details" page shows empty fields and no data, making it impossible to view the results of completed pump analysis runs. The issue appears to affect both the summary information and the detailed run data display.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing completed analysis run results, I want to see all run data properly loaded and displayed, so that I can review the analysis outcomes and statistics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to a run details page THEN all run summary data SHALL be properly loaded and displayed
2. WHEN the run data is available THEN the range, duration, total hits, and max multiplier SHALL be visible
3. WHEN the API returns run data THEN the difficulty, median multiplier, engine version, and targets SHALL be displayed correctly
4. WHEN the page loads THEN no fields SHALL be empty if data exists in the backend

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user troubleshooting data loading issues, I want clear error handling and loading states, so that I can understand if there's a problem with data retrieval.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API call fails THEN a clear error message SHALL be displayed to the user
2. WHEN data is loading THEN a loading indicator SHALL be shown
3. WHEN the run ID is invalid THEN an appropriate error message SHALL be displayed
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the user SHALL receive feedback about the connection problem

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user viewing run results, I want the target counts section to display properly, so that I can see the distribution of hits across different multiplier thresholds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN run data includes target counts THEN the target counts grid SHALL display all target multipliers
2. WHEN target data is available THEN each target SHALL show the correct count of hits
3. WHEN the counts_by_target data is present THEN it SHALL be sorted and formatted properly
4. WHEN no target data exists THEN an appropriate message SHALL be displayed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user reviewing analysis parameters, I want the seeds section to display correctly, so that I can verify the server and client seeds used in the analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN run data includes seeds THEN both server seed and client seed SHALL be displayed
2. WHEN seeds are displayed THEN they SHALL be properly formatted in monospace font
3. WHEN the user clicks copy buttons THEN the seeds SHALL be copied to clipboard successfully
4. WHEN seeds are very long THEN they SHALL be displayed with proper text wrapping

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user examining detailed results, I want the hits table to load and display properly, so that I can see individual nonce results and their multipliers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hits data is available THEN the hits table SHALL display all hit records
2. WHEN hits are loading THEN a loading indicator SHALL be shown in the table area
3. WHEN filtering by minimum multiplier THEN the table SHALL update with filtered results
4. WHEN pagination is needed THEN the pagination controls SHALL work correctly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer debugging the issue, I want proper API error handling and logging, so that I can identify the root cause of data loading failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN error details SHALL be logged to the browser console
2. WHEN data parsing fails THEN the specific parsing error SHALL be captured
3. WHEN the backend returns unexpected data format THEN the frontend SHALL handle it gracefully
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN network requests SHALL be visible in browser dev tools
