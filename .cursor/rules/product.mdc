# Product Overview

## Pump Analyzer Web

A local-first web application for analyzing Stake Pump game outcomes using provably-fair cryptographic replay. The tool deterministically replays betting sequences for given seed pairs and nonce ranges, storing results for later analysis and export.

### Core Features

- **Deterministic Replay**: Cryptographically accurate recreation of Stake Pump outcomes using HMAC-SHA256 with server/client seed pairs
- **Multi-Difficulty Support**: Handles all Pump difficulties (easy/medium/hard/expert) with corresponding multiplier tables
- **Batch Analysis**: Process up to 500k nonces per run with configurable target multipliers
- **Data Persistence**: SQLite storage for runs, hits, and analysis results with CSV export capabilities
- **Live Streams**: Real-time ingestion and monitoring of filtered betting data from external sources

### Target Users

- Cryptocurrency gambling analysts
- Provably-fair gaming researchers
- Betting pattern investigators
- Users requiring deterministic outcome verification

### Key Principles

- **Deterministic Correctness**: Identical inputs must produce identical outputs across all platforms
- **Local Privacy**: All data stored locally in SQLite, no cloud dependencies
- **Performance Focus**: 200k nonces analyzed in â‰¤10 seconds on target hardware
- **Single-User Design**: Local-first architecture with no authentication requirements
- **Operational Safety**: Live Streams ingestion is protected by token auth and rate limiting by default
